# Singapore Income Tax Calculator

## Introduction
A Singapore personal income tax calculator coded in Python language. It runs from the command line and takes in user input to calculate income tax payable based on information relating to YA2022 (FY2021).

As I am a beginner in python programming and this is my first personal project, kindly let me know if there are any errors :)

The tax computation structure for this project is based on IRAS's tax calculator. Kindly refer to the excel file titled '**Tax-calculator_Residents_YA22**' for the full tax computation structure from IRAS.

### Assumptions made:
- User is a tax resident of Singapore (i.e. Eligible for personal reliefs)
- No sharing of personal reliefs (i.e. No apportionment of tax reliefs with spouse/ex-spouse)
- Computes minimum tax payable (i.e. maximum personal reliefs to be claimed)
